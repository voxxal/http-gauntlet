# http gauntlet

Designed for [CyberClass](https://cyberclasscamp.com). The HTTP gauntlet is an application that helps users better understand how HTTP works by putting users through many different challenges.

The goal of the HTTP gauntlet is to provide an interactive tour of HTTP while helping users get back on track whenever they might make errors in your HTTP request. The HTTP gauntlet has many different checks and error messages to help you out.

This project is still WIP but here are the planned topics.
 - [x] HTTP request header (method, path, protocol/version)
 - [X] Headers
 - [ ] Body
   - [ ] Different body types
 - [ ] Cookies

## Usage
 - Start the `main.cr` server. (This requires the [Crystal Programming Language](https://crystal-lang.org) installed)
 - Write your HTTP request into the `client.py` BODY variable, and run `client.py`.
 - Enjoy.
